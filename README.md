Requires WBComDesigns LearnDash Dashboard plugin and, of course, LearnDash.
This is a very basic plugin enhancing WBComDesigns "LearnDash Dashboard" plugin that simply launches the Lesson, Topic, and Quiz editors 
in a modal when authoring from within the Builder view.
This does <not> support launching those modals from the regular LD menu via WP-Admin.
Enhancements could include:
- Further filtering of editor elements
- Performance
- Support of WP Shortcodes (which are currently sanitized)
- Consistency of association between Quiz/Lesson/Course... possible bug.
